# Park-Inspector

[Live app](https://tmak1.github.io/park-spectre-client/)

Park-Inspector is an app that reads in the data from the [API we created](https://github.com/tmak1/park-spectre-api) and creates the user interface.

## Challenges
* Getting the pins to draw on map and update without causing long load times and delays in the UX
* Info box appearing for each pin
* Filtering

## Cool Tech
* Bing map API
* Link between parking bay information list and map
* Updating pins every 40 seconds

## Team work
* Team members: Camilla, David, Gordon, & Tarik
* Collaborated on two different aps on GitHub effectively
